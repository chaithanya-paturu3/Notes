cut command
=============
echo "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAWS-82S/notes/refs/heads/main/session-02.md" | cut -d "/" -f9
session-02.md

awk command 
=============
echo "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAWS-82S/notes/refs/heads/main/session-02.md" | awk -F "/" '{print $NF}' ==> NF means to print for the last item

How can we get all the  users in Linux Servers
awk -F ":" '{print $1F}' passwd  = file name 

find <which-location> -name "<file-name>"
:
find / -name "passwd" ==> file name
